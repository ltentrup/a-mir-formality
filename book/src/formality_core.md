# `formality_core`: the Formality system

`a-mir-formality` is build on the formality core system,
defined by the `formality_core` crate.
Formality core is a mildly opnionated series of macros, derives, and types
that let you write high-level Rust code
in a way that resembles standard type theory notation.
Its primary purpose is to be used by a-mir-formality
but it can be used for other projects.
